Objects and its internal representation in JavaScript:

    The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life and the properties 
    of the object.An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association 
    between a name (or key) and a value.Javascript objects are represented with curly braces({})
    and the properties are written as key value:pairs and they are separated by commas(,).

    example:
             const student = {
                name:"Ram",
                age:15,
                class:10
            };

Accessing Object properties:
    
    we can access the object properties in two ways
         1)By objectName.propertyname

             from above example:
             console.log(student.name);

                  OR

         2)By objectName["propertyname]
            
            console.log(student["name"]);
